# .env.test
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/success_academy_test" # Example, use your actual test DB connection
APP_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Base URL for supertest

# Ensure this is different from your development .env to avoid conflicts
# You might need to create a separate test database.
# For local Docker setup, you might connect to the same DB instance but use a different database name or be careful with cleanup.
# For this example, I'm assuming a local postgres and a test DB named success_academy_test
# If your main DB is success_academy, you can often create success_academy_test alongside it.
# Make sure your local Postgres server is running and accessible.
# If you are using the docker-compose setup from the project, the DB is at localhost:5432 (default)
# and the default user/pass is postgres/postgres, database is success_academy.
# For testing, it's best to use a *separate* database (e.g., success_academy_test).
# You might need to manually create this database: CREATE DATABASE success_academy_test;
# Or, if your schema.sql handles "IF NOT EXISTS", running it against a new DB name is fine.
